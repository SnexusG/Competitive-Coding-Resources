## Getting Started with Competitive Programming
  Programming, at its core is problem solving using code. Competitive programming makes it a sport where you compete with other people to solve some in a limited time period. As per [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming), "Competitive programming is a mind sport usually held over the Internet or a local network, involving participants trying to program according to provided specifications."
